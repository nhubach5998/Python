#Create a program that uses a loop to print out the numbers 0-9.
print("This is series from 0 to 9")
for i in range(10):
    print(i,end="\t")
#Then add another loop that prints out the numbers 1-10.
print("\nThis is series from 1 to 10")
for i in range(1:11)
    print(i,end="\t")
#Then add some more code to print out the numbers 0-9 in one column and the numbers 10-19 in a column next to it
print("This is series print out 2 column from 0-9 and 10-19")
